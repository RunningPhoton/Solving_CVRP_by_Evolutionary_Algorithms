# Solving_CVRP_by_Evolutionary_Algorithms
Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP - NP Hard) using Evolutionary Algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Stochastic Hill climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search)

Genetic Algorithm implementation can be found in "genetic.cpp" file. File "myDT3.h" whcih contains the necessary data structures should be used as a header for this file

Implementation of Stochastic Hill climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search can be found in "SHC-Annealing-Tabu_search.cpp". In the main function of this file[end of the file], the selected method to solve the problem can be used. Note that the uploaded file in the current repository called "myDT.h" which contains the necessary should be added to this file.

Note that either one of the pairs of files <"genetic.cpp" & "myDT3.h">  or <"SHC-Annealing-Tabu_search.cpp" & "myDT.h"> should be added to a single project and all of them should not be run simultanousely.
 
file named "Ank_80.txt" which also can be found in the current repository can be used as test data
